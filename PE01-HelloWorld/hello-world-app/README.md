<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The program begins by requesting the user to provide a temperature in `F. This is achieved by using
the Output command to display a prompt("Enter `F temperature:") and then waits for the user's response
with the Input command. The user's input is then stored in the fahrenheit variable`.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>Once the temperature in `F is acquired, the program proceeds to the calculation phase. The formula
(fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9 is applied to convert the `F value into its equivalent `C temperature. This
conversion formula is a well-known method for converting `F to `C. The result of this computation is
then assigned to the celsius variable.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Finally, the program generates an output for the user. It uses the Output command to display both the
original Fahrenheit tempperature and the calculated Celsius equivalent in a structured sentence format: "[fahrenheit value]` Fahnrenheit is [celsius value]` Celcius". The user can then clearly see the result of the conversion.</p>
