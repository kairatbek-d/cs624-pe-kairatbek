# Input
The app has 6 small profile cards on one screen. Each of them is the same, except for these profiles. The data is located in several components: `View`, `Text` and `Image`. Since we studied design in this module, we used styles in this profile card.

# Process
By launching our application, we can see information about users in 6 small profiles: image, name, occupation and description. In each component, we have set various properties such as `size`, `color`, `height`, `width`, `border`, `background`, `font`, `text and container shadows`. For various platforms like `IOS` and `Android`, we have also designed some containers to see the power of React Native.

# Output
The output is a visual representation of profile cards. When we click one one of them, it will expand and display all the profile data in a larger size. But after another press, it will become as small as before.
